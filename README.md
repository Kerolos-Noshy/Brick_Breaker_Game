# Brick Breaker Game

## Overview
This is a group project for data structure course. The objective of this project is to apply our knowledge of data structures by implementing the popular game Brick Breaker and creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using C++ and Qt.

The game is built using a quadtree data structure, which is a tree-like data structure that recursively divides a two-dimensional space into four quadrants. This data structure allows for efficient collision detection and handling between the ball and the bricks.

## Getting Started
To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Qt Creator.

3. Compile the source code using Qt Creator.

4. Run the compiled file.

**you can download the compressed file `brick breaker exe.rar` and enjoy the game.** 

## How to Play
The objective of the game is to break all the bricks on the screen using a ball and a paddle. Move the paddle horizontally using the mouse to prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen. When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears and the ball bounces back. The game ends when either all the bricks are broken or the ball falls off the bottom of the screen.
